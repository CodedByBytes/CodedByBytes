# 👋 Hi, my name is Ankit.

## 🧑‍💼 Middleware Integration Consultant, Certified Scrum Master, Architecture Design & Corporate Trainer  

 I am a seasoned Software Development Engineer with 10 years of experience in designing and developing software solutions within Agile environments. My expertise lies in integrating large-scale distributed systems and creating low-latency applications.
Having spent a year as a Spring Boot and Apache Camel developer in London for an RMG client, I am proficient in technologies such as Apache Camel, Spring Boot, Red Hat JBOSS-Fuse, Java/J2EE, Hibernate, and MuleSoft 4.2. I am also a certified Scrum Master and am pursuing a career as an Agile Coach.
I excel in writing technical documentation, conducting unit tests, and deploying code using CI/CD practices. Currently, I focus on distributed systems and real-time data streaming, leveraging my skills in Java, Spring, and Apache Camel to deliver high-quality solutions that drive business success.
